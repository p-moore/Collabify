WHAT
Collabify - a project management web application designed to assist teams in project development by encouraging collaboration. This project makes it easy to visualize project workloads by allowing users to view their tasks via a Kanban board.

WHY
I started this project two years ago in an object oriented design class at LSU, then following that I used it again in a software engineering course. The original purpose of this project was to make it easier for users (specifically targeting programmers) to be transparent with their work so that everyone is on the same (Kanban board) page.
