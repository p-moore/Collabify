WHAT
Collabify - a project management web application designed to assist teams in project development by encouraging collaboration. This project makes it easy to visualize project workloads by allowing users to view their tasks via a Kanban board.

WHY
I started this project two years ago in an object oriented design class at LSU, then following that I used it again in a software engineering course. The original purpose of this project was to make it easier for users (specifically targeting programmers) to be transparent with their work so that everyone is on the same (Kanban board) page. The purpose then shifted to aiding my CSC 4330 professor give assignments to his students easily. I quickly realized that this was no easy task and likely would not be finished within a semester. I am now trying to finish the project so that I can give it back to him before I graduate from LSU. My end goal is to have my software being used in an LSU classroom.
